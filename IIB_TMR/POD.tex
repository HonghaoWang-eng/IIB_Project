\section{Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for MOR}

To perform MOR before passing the data to training the NN, proper orthogonal decomposition(POD) is used with the facilitation by the RBniCSx package. In particular, upon receiving the PDE data snapshot matrix, singular value decomposition is performed, which allows us to pick the most significant singular values and their related modes. Detailed codes of this part have been compiled before the start date of this project, but they have been thoroughly studied to integrate them with the NN building packages for development purposes.
