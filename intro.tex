\section{Introduction}
Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) underpins critical scientific advancements across diverse fields. Nowadays, enhanced computational capabilities combined with improved algorithms allow for high-fidelity numerical solutions to intricate problems using standard discretisation methods. For example, classical methods such as the finite element method (FEM) are used to solve the governing PDE. In this project, we are interested in solving the high-fidelity FEM model repeatedly. However, this could pose very high stress on the limited computational resources because solving high-fidelity models for various parameters usually involves computing a large number of degrees of freedom for the solution. Hence, using the full-order model usually requires access to high-performance computing systems, and the process can be expensive. 

To address the issue, model order reduction (MOR) helps to alleviate the computational burden by identifying a lower dimensional representation of the parametric dependence of the high-fidelity model. The basic idea on which MOR is based is related to the fact that often the parametric dependence of the problem at hand has an intrinsic dimension much lower than the number of degrees of freedom associated to the governing high-fidelity solution \cite{shah2022finite}. There are two stages in an MOR procedure. The first one is an offline stage. During this stage, a large number of solution manifolds (solved under different initialisations of parameters) are collected together to form a solution snapshot matrix. The MOR algorithm can then be run on the snapshot matrix, which identifies the most significant modes that form the reduced basis space. Stage two is an online stage where information regarding the reduced basis space is fully utilised, which allows for the computing of the projections of new high-fidelity solutions onto the lower intrinsic dimensions. 

This project focused on the mixed formulation for the Poisson equation, which included an extra vector term $\sigma$ that represented the flux of the scalar field in the Poisson equation. The parametrisation of PDEs incorporated changing variables in the governing equations that allowed for more flexibility in the system. In this report, we explain the choices of the parameters through the MOR results. 

We aim to develop a framework for data-driven MOR by combining Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The method involves identifying reduced basis space by performing POD (with the RBniCSx package), training the ANN with snapshots of PDE solutions as inputs, and using the trained ANN for a quick approximation of the solution field of a PDE. While offering data-driven efficiency and reducing reliance on high-fidelity FEM models, the trade-offs include a sacrifice in accuracy and extended training times for the ANN. The loss in accuracy was particularly evident in the vector field. Achieving a balance between accuracy and efficiency is crucial for the successful implementation of this approach.

To accelerate the runtime of the programme, this project leverages supercomputers through data-parallel computing, which divides tasks into smaller sub-tasks, allowing multiple processors to simultaneously execute computations. Both CPU and GPU-based parallelisation were utilised in the project. The CPU-based parallelisation involves distributing the computational workload across multiple CPU cores to accelerate the generation of data. This involves solving large-scale PDEs with the FEM library FEniCSx, specifically for computing the reduced basis functions in POD and for obtaining the ANN training data; In the context of ANN training, the GPU-based parallelisation was utilised with the help of TensorFlow. Partitions of the dataset are distributed to individual processors, each handling its subset of the dataset. Through distributed ANN training, parallel processing accelerates the learning process. The outputs during each training epoch (e.g. losses and gradients) are synchronised among processors.

Below is a summary of the workflow of this project, which will be discussed in greater depth in this report. In Section 2, we will introduce the governing equation of the mixed formulation for the Poisson equation and how the traditional finite element method is used to solve for the full-order solution. Section 3 focuses on the concept of parametrised 
PDEs and explain our choices of parameters focused on the project. In Section 4, the idea of MOR is explained in detail, and we will discuss the result and the effectiveness of MOR in reducing dimensionality, along with a detailed explanation of the choice for parameterisation. The use of ANN will then be covered in Section 5, followed by a presentation of the numerical results in Section 6. Lastly, the concept of both GPU and CPU parallelization is covered in Section 7.
